# CONTRIBUTING
---

The contributions made by both R package designers is as follows:

Each member shall design and implement one function utilizing the driveBC API, and provides the necessary documentation and testing for their respecitive API wrapper functions. R package designers are encouraged to create their own branches from a shared git repository, in which they can test and develop their functions in parallel. Once functionality and proper documentation and testing has been supplied and performed, members will merge their work into the master git repository for package submission.
